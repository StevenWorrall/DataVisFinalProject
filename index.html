	<div class="title">Rap Music's Influence on Search Trends</div>
	<p class="startingPara">Music industries have been growing exponentially; every year thereâ€™s more and more popular musicians/bands collaborating with major companies to advertise new products in songs. In particular, Rap music has become very popular over time, especially since the appearance of Drake and Kanye West. Both of them have collaborated with major fashion brands like Nike and Adidas along with many other big brands. After analyzing the lyrics in their songs, this becomes quite apparent. Given this, we wanted to know how true this actually was and how deep it actually went. The question we want to answer is: what effect have rappers had on search trends? More to the point, can we better describe a possible niche to market products in? After reviewing data, we think it might be possible to correlate the popularity of search trends with songs used in popular rap music throughout the last 10-15 years. </p>
